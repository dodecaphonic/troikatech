    <p><em>“Maybe Emacs is not enough.”</em></p>

<p>That popped up in my mind, and it scared me. I knew Scala was a different beast; I knew there was probably a lot I was missing out on by using my tried-and-true workflows; I knew that IntelliJ was supposed to be amazing. Still, thinking Emacs-the-almighty was not enough frightened me.</p>

<p>When I started on this slow path towards learning FP, I had been using dynamic languages almost exclusively for almost 14 years, with a short stop in C++-land for a couple of them. I was used to a world of mostly ok tools centered on a REPL, and it was fine — programming is more thinking than typing and clicking, that whole <em>spiel</em>. But I had never really done anything in a good type system, and, frankly, it was time I knew how the rest of the world leveraged their tools in order to work more comfortably and effectively.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I evaluated the Typesafe IDE and IntelliJ IDEA 12 and 13, finding a lot of good in both tools (and a few problems, some discussed in my post about the <a href="/blog/2014/01/12/reactive">Reactive Programming course</a>). Still, after a few good days with each option, I was tempted to just go back to Emacs and rely on my memory (and <a href="http://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a>) for the API signatures, do all my code refactorings by hand and use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sbt console</code> for quick explorations.</p>

<p>Then I found out I could have the cake and eat it too.</p>

<h2 id="enter-ensime">Enter ENSIME</h2>

<p>ENSIME (<strong>ENhanced Scala Interaction Mode for Emacs</strong>) is a project that gives Emacs IDE-like capabilities. It performs type and error-checking as you write code, provides symbol inspection, facilities for browsing your codebase and performing automated refactorings. It accomplishes all that using the <a href="http://scala-ide.org/docs/dev/architecture/presentation-compiler.html">Scala Presentation Compiler</a>, a lightweight version of the infrastructure that goes only as far as needed to resolve types, find errors and do semantic highlighting.</p>

<p>Setting it up is super simple. Using MELPA, install the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ensime</code> package. Then add the following to your Emacs config:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(require 'ensime)
(add-hook 'scala-mode-hook 'ensime-scala-mode-hook)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then add the plugin to your global <code class="highlighter-rouge">sbt</code> config (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugins.sbt</code>):</p>

<div class="language-scala highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">resolvers</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="nc">Resolver</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sonatypeRepo</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"snapshots"</span><span class="o">)</span>

<span class="n">addSbtPlugin</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"org.ensime"</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="s">"ensime-sbt"</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="s">"0.1.5-SNAPSHOT"</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then, in your project directory, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">sbt gen-ensime</code> (requires sbt &gt;= 0.13.5). It will resolve the dependencies, install the ENSIME plugin and leave everything ready to go.</p>

<p>Now, when you open a buffer, you’re gonna see the following in your mode line:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/zss0kz5lr8hvhmr/2014-11-27%20at%2010.22.png" title="ENSIME Disconnected" /></p>

<p>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">M-x ensime</code> to start a connection. It might take a few seconds for it to do what it must to analyze your project, but you’ll eventually see the mode line change to show it’s ready to work.</p>

<h2 id="code-completion">Code completion</h2>

<p>One of the cool things ENSIME provides is real code completion, based on the type you’re dealing with. Instead of the usual <code class="highlighter-rouge">M-/</code> cycling, you can explore an API by looking at the method signatures and documentation. Here’s the thing in action:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/troikatech/ensime_as_ide/completion.gif" title="Completing" /></p>

<h2 id="type-inspection">Type inspection</h2>

<p>Sometimes Scala’s type inference engine gets confused, giving you something too broad or too narrow for your needs; other times, you just want to know the type of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">val</code>. Worry not: ENSIME can tell you what has been inferenced just by putting the cursor over the token you want and pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">C-c C-v i</code> (works a bit like <code class="highlighter-rouge">:t</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">ghci</code>).</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/troikatech/ensime_as_ide/type_at_point.gif" title="Inspecting types" /></p>

<p>You can also show uses of a symbol by pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">C-c C-v r</code>.</p>

<h2 id="automated-refactorings">Automated Refactorings</h2>

<p>ENSIME offers six simple, but extremely useful automated refactorings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inline Local</li>
  <li>Extract Local</li>
  <li>Extract Method</li>
  <li>Rename</li>
  <li>Organize Imports</li>
  <li>Import Type at Point</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/troikatech/ensime_as_ide/refactoring.gif" title="Refactoring" /></p>

<p>Of all of these, <em>Import Type at Point</em> is the only one I’d consider flaky. It resolves the type perfectly, but inserts the <code class="highlighter-rouge">import</code> statement inline. I don’t know if that’s configurable. Otherwise, it works as many other automated tools: finds each change, shows you the substitution, asks you to ok it.</p>

<h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>

<p>You can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">M-.</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">M-*</code>, normally associated with finding tags, to move inside your project.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/troikatech/ensime_as_ide/navigation.gif" title="Navigation" /></p>

<p>You can also jump from implementation to test, and vice versa.</p>

<h2 id="scala-and-sbt-integration"><code class="highlighter-rouge">scala</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">sbt</code> integration</h2>

<p>If you press <code class="highlighter-rouge">C-c C-v s</code>, an sbt console will be launched. A lot of my usual Ruby workflow of running specs from keybinds and jumping quickly to the REPL can be reproduced with this feature.</p>

<p>For instance, when you want to run all tests, you press <code class="highlighter-rouge">C-c C-b T</code>. When you wish only to invoke <code class="highlighter-rouge">testQuick</code>, you use <code class="highlighter-rouge">C-c C-b t</code>.</p>

<p>There’s keybinds for changing a region or a buffer, too — useful both for playing with code and exercising your Emacs gymnastics.</p>

<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>

<p>ENSIME has been fun to work with. It allows me to focus on code and work comfortably with my (admittedly small) projects. It’s a great showcase of Emacs capabilities, and has led a couple of hardcore vim-using friends to show admiration.</p>

<p>If you’re doing Scala and don’t want to commit to an IDE, but wish to have more of a modern environment, please try ENSIME. I even hear there’s vim and jEdit clients.</p>
