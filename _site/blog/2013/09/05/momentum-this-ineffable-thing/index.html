    <p>Revisiting the book, it has surprised me to find a lot of the ideas familiar, some of them even mundane. Since trying it the last (three years ago? four?), I have delved a bit into functional programming via Scala (I did <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">Martin Odersky’s “Functional Programming Principles in Scala”</a> last semester) and Clojure, and the things I learned in <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer">The Little Schemer</a> weren’t all forgotten. The substitution model, for one, feels very natural, and recursion is not that difficult to reason about.</p>

<p>What I’m doing differently this time is following along with the <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/">1986 lectures</a>, which at least one person in every SICP-related Reddit/HN thread has recommended (and I ignored). I usually prefer learning from books and documentation, but the lectures have the benefit of requiring focus and monotasking. Also, listening to the audience’s questions makes me a bit more aware of what is hard for a person with the Math background but not the programming skills — the exact opposite of my situation, and a great aid in keeping things in perspective.</p>

<p>As predicted, said Math-heaviness still makes me a little bit uncomfortable, but I’m soldiering through. That means stopping at an exercise, reading Wikipedia and sometimes just taking things at face-value, as I don’t have the intuitions someone more familiar with the subject matter would. It takes some patience, sometimes, and I would be lying if I told you it doesn’t discourage me a bit.</p>

<p>That said, Chapter 1 is done. Now on to Chapter 2. Wish me luck.</p>
